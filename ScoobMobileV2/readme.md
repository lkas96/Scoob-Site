# Requirements
To use Expo, you need to have the following tools installed on your machine:
- Node.js LTS release - Only Node.js LTS releases (even-numbered) are recommended.
As Node.js officially states, "Production applications should only use Active LTS or Maintenance LTS releases". You can install Node.js using a version management tool (such as `nvm` or `volta` or any other of your choice) to switch between different Node.js versions.
- Git for source control.
- Watchman (for Linux or macOS users).

# Get Started
After installing Node.js, and downloading our source code (either through downloading the zip file or cloning from our repo), you can use `cd` into the `ScoobMobileV2` directory and use `npx` to start the app.
```zsh
# To change directory to ScoobMobileV2

# To download relevant dependencies on local machine
npm install

# To start the application on your machine
npx expo start
```
